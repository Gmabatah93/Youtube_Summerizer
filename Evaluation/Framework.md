## Agentic Systems Evaluation Framework

A specialized framework for assessing AI agents designed to autonomously perceive, reason, and act toward goals.

### 1. Mission & Goal Definition üéØ

- **Goal Clarity & Decomposability:** Is the agent‚Äôs primary goal clear and unambiguous? Can complex goals be broken into smaller, verifiable sub-tasks? Is the objective function robust against "reward hacking"?
- **Success Measurement:** How is success measured? Consider metrics like task completion rate, efficiency (resources, steps, time), and outcome quality.
- **Scope & Boundaries:** Are operational boundaries defined? Does the agent understand its authority limits and restricted domains?
- **Business & User Alignment:** Does the mission support a business process or user need? Is the value proposition clear?

### 2. Agent Core Capabilities üß†

- **Reasoning & Planning Engine:** How advanced is the agent‚Äôs planning? Does it use simple lists or sophisticated techniques (e.g., Chain-of-Thought, Tree-of-Thought)? Can it adapt to unforeseen obstacles?
- **Knowledge & Memory:** How does the agent manage information? Assess short-term (context window) and long-term memory reliability, update mechanisms, and retrieval.
- **Learning & Adaptation:** Is the agent static or adaptive? Can it self-improve and avoid learning harmful behaviors?
- **Model Selection:** Is the underlying LLM or foundation model suitable for the agent‚Äôs tasks (reasoning, instruction-following, tool use)?

### 3. Environment & Tool Integration üõ†Ô∏è

- **Perception & Environment Awareness:** How does the agent perceive its environment? Evaluate information-gathering tools (web scrapers, APIs, sensors).
- **Tool Use & API Mastery:** Can the agent select, use, and interpret external tools? Assess tool calling, error handling, and tool breadth.
- **Action Space:** What actions can the agent perform? Is the action space well-defined and constrained to prevent harm?
- **Feedback Loop:** How does the agent receive feedback on its actions? Evaluate feedback accuracy and latency.

### 4. Safety, Control & Governance üõ°Ô∏è

- **Containment & Failsafes:** What mechanisms exist to stop, pause, or override the agent? Is there a reliable "off switch" outside agent control? Is the agent sandboxed?
- **Decision-Making Guardrails:** Are there rules or ethical constraints? Are high-stakes decisions flagged for human review?
- **Resilience to Adversarial Attacks:** How does the system defend against prompt injection, tool manipulation, or goal hijacking?
- **Auditability & Logging:** Are all actions and decisions logged for review? Is there a complete audit trail?

### 5. Operational Readiness & MLOps for Agents ‚öôÔ∏è

- **Monitoring & Observability:** What metrics are monitored? Include agent-specific metrics (token use, tool frequency, task success/failure, human intervention).
- **Testing & Evaluation Suite:** How is the agent tested? Use simulation environments and scenario-based testing.
- **Deployment & Lifecycle Management:** Is there a process for updating prompts, models, or tools? How are changes rolled out safely?
- **Cost Management:** Is there a system for tracking and managing operational costs per task or agent?

1. Task Success and Goal Accomplishment
    - **Completeness:** was the enitre taks addressed?
    - **Correctness:** was the final output or action correct based on the task definition?
    - **Relevance:** did the agent stay on topic and address the core request?
    - **Constraint Adherence:** did the agent follow all specified or negative constraints ?
2. Accuracy and Factuality
    - **Factual Correctness:** are specific claims or data points accurate?
    - **Hallucinations:** does agent generate false information
    - **Source Grounding:** is information traceable with grouded source?
    - **Freshness:** is this the msot up-to date information
3. Safety and Responsibility
    -  **Bias Mitigation:** does it avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes or biases ?
    - **Ethical Compliance:** does it follow specified ethical guidelines or rules of engagement ?
    - **Privacy Protection:** does it avoid requesting or revealing sensitive PII inappropriately?
    - **Harm Avoidance:** does it refreain from genereating toxic, hateful, illegal etc. suggestions?
4. Robustness and Reliability
    - **Error Recovery:** ability to recover from failed actions, API calls, Tools errors etc.
    - **Adversarial Attack:** resistance to prmpt meant to break rules or jailbreak
    - **Consistency:** produce similar outputs for similar inputs
    - **Edge case handling:** How to handle rare or unusual requests
5. System Efficiency: Cost, Tool Use, Latency
    - **Latency:** how quickly does the agent complete the tasks or respond
    - **Token Consumption:** number of inputs/output token processed (cost/context limits)
    - **Compuational Cost:** underlying compute resources used (CPU, GPU, Memory)
    - **API Call Usage:** number and type of external tool/API calls made (cost & latency)
    - **Task Steps:** number of interactions or reasoning steps needed
6. Reasoning & Planning Quality
    - **Logical Soundness:** does the reasoning follow logical principles ?
    - **Problem Decomposition:** can system break complex task into manageable small tasks?
    - **Step Accuracy:** are individual reasoning steps correct?
    - **Explanation Clarity:** can agent clearly articulate its reasoning process?
